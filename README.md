The Design Principles I have implemented:
Balance: Create negative spacing so the users focus is on the text in the center of the screen.
Type: There is a big clear purpose of the site at the top of the page.
User flow: There is a clear flow from the top to the bottom of the page.
Hierachy: The page directs the user towards the form to fill in.
Consistency: There is the same font and colours used throughout the site.
Simpicity: The information is clear and chunked together.
Imagery: big and sparing text with bright colors to associate with a kids vibe.
Typography: Used comic sans to stay with the childrens vibe.

I have used media queries to make the page adjust to 3 different screen sizes eg mobile, ipad and computer.
I ensured that content is presented well and the app has some thought given to design, so that it is more appealing to use.

I have ensured that form inputs have got associated descriptions to prevent confusion.

I have met accessibility needs within my page with ARIA labels describing everything and a tab index so the user can move through the page in the correct order and using the keyboard.

I have a form that successfully retrieves user input and then uses fetch requests to get specific data from several APIs by using extra query parameters which gives my app enhanced functionality.
